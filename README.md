# PokeDex App

### Description

I developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on consuming data from the PokeAPI. The purpose of the application is to display information about first-generation PokÃ©mon through cards.

Each card showcases crucial details such as the name, image, and other relevant information about the PokÃ©mon. HTML was used for content structuring, CSS for styling and design to provide an appealing visual experience. Additionally, JavaScript was employed to create interactivity, allowing users to explore the cards dynamically.

This application offers a personal and engaging way to learn more about first-generation PokÃ©mon. I hope fans enjoy the experience, making the most of the capabilities of modern web technologies.
